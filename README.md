Reading the notes
=================

The easiest way to view these notes is to plug any raw .ipynb file into an ipython notebook viewer, such as [this one](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).

- [Lecture 1 Notes](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rblakemesser/distributed-systems-notes/blob/master/lecture_01.ipynb)
- [Lecture 2 Notes](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rblakemesser/distributed-systems-notes/blob/master/lecture_02.ipynb)
- [Lecture 3 Notes](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rblakemesser/distributed-systems-notes/blob/master/lecture_03.ipynb)

Contribute
=================

Follow the instructions [to set up your own ipython notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/notebook.html).

I will also make corrections if you send me an email or comment on this project.
